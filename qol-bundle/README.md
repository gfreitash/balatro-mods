# QOL Bundle

A collection of quality-of-life improvements for Balatro.

## How It Works

This mod provides several small adjustments to gameplay mechanics to enhance the overall experience, particularly when using other mods that add new content.

## Key Features

- **Easier Wheel of Fortune**: Configurable ease for the Wheel of Fortune tarot card. Adjust the chance of hitting the desired outcome (1 = 100% chance, 4 = vanilla 25% chance). Default is 3.
- **Wildcard Fix**: Prevents Wildcard and Smeared Joker from being negatively affected by suit debuffs when they could match a non-debuffed suit.
- **Increased Shop Size**: Increases the base shop size by 1 (default is 2). This helps offset the dilution of the shop pool caused by other mods adding new cards and items.
