# QOL Bundle

A collection of quality-of-life improvements for Balatro.

## How It Works

This mod provides several small adjustments to gameplay mechanics to enhance the overall experience, particularly when using other mods that add new content.

## Features

- **Easier Wheel of Fortune**: Configurable ease for the Wheel of Fortune tarot card. Adjust the chance of hitting the desired outcome (1 = 100% chance, 4 = vanilla 25% chance). Default is 3.
- **Wildcard Fix**: Prevents Wildcard and Smeared Joker from being negatively affected by suit debuffs when they could match a non-debuffed suit. When Paperback mod is installed, Smeared Joker considers light suits and dark suits, respectively, as the same suit.
- **Increased Shop Size**: Increases the base shop size by 1 (default is 2). This helps offset the dilution of the shop pool caused by other mods adding new cards and items.
- **Unweighted Base Editions**: Makes Foil, Holo, and Polychrome editions equally likely when rolled, while preserving the original probability of Negative editions.
- **Configurable 8 Ball Joker**: Adjust the chance of the 8 Ball Joker spawning Tarot cards (1 = 100% chance, 4 = vanilla 25% chance). Default is 4.
- **Reworked Hit the Road Joker**: When enabled, discarded Jacks are returned to the deck alongside the current effect.
- **Square Joker Modification**: Reworks the Square Joker to give +4 chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards, with each scoring card having a 1 in 2 chance to add +4 more chips. Also changes rarity to Uncommon.
- **Flower Pot Wildcard Rework**: Flower Pot only appears in shop when Wildcard-enhanced cards exist in deck and triggers when scoring hand contains any Wildcard.
- **Baron Uncommon**: Makes Baron joker Uncommon rarity with reduced cost ($5 instead of $8).
- **Mime Rare**: Makes Mime joker Rare rarity with increased cost ($6 instead of $5).
- **Satellite Joker Rework**: Satellite now gives gold equal to half the highest poker hand level (rounded down).
- **Controlled Sigil**: Sigil now requires selecting a card first and converts all cards to selected card's suit instead of random suit.
- **Controlled Ouija**: Ouija now requires selecting a card first and converts all cards to selected card's rank instead of random rank.
- **Loyalty Card Rounds Mode**: Loyalty Card triggers based on rounds instead of hands played for more predictable timing and easier to plan around.
- **Splash Joker Retrigger**: Splash Joker additionally retriggers a random scoring card.
- **Ceremonial Dagger Common**: Makes Ceremonial Dagger joker Common rarity with reduced cost ($3 instead of $6).
- **Mail-In Rebate Uncommon**: Makes Mail-In Rebate joker Uncommon rarity (was Common rarity - makes it rarer).
- **Fortune Teller Cheaper**: Makes Fortune Teller joker cheaper (cost $4 instead of $6).
- **Erosion X Mult Rework**: Changes Erosion from +4 Mult per card to X0.15 Mult per card below starting amount.
- **Interest on Skip**: Gain interest when skipping blinds, calculated and awarded before obtaining the tag.
- **Paperback Compatibility**: Added compatibility for Paperback mod's Jester of Nihil joker and suit considerations for Smeared Joker.
- **Nerf Hanging Chad**: Makes Hanging Chad joker Uncommon rarity and more expensive (cost $7 instead of $6).
- **Castle Checkered Reliability**: Castle now counts either Clubs and Spades or Hearts and Diamonds, making it as reliable as in the checkered deck. If Paperback mod is installed, light suits or dark suits will be used instead.
- **Yorick Enhancement**: Yorick now gains a configurable amount (+1.5x for each 23 cards instead of +1x).
- **Reworked Magic Trick and Illusion Vouchers**: 
    - Magic Trick is now a "better" Illusion voucher with playing cards in shop appearing with enhancements, editions and seals (actually spawn instead of the bugged vanilla). 
    - Illusion now shows cards that are clones of cards in your deck with ability to reroll their enhancements, editions, and seals (but never lose them).
    - Improved shop card pricing accounts for enhancements, editions, and seals. Baseline is more expensive and can go up to $6
    - **Paper Clips Support**: Magic Trick and Illusion vouchers now may apply paper clips to shop playing cards (same as seals) when Paperback mod is installed.
