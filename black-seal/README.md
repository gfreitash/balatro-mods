This is a port of the original Black Seal mod to newer versions of Steamodded.

This mod adds a rare black seal to the game. When a card with black seal is used it will apply negative edition to a random eligible joker.

- All other black seals in the deck will be removed, seals in cards in hand will be kept.
- Can be found anywhere a random seal is may appear, most commonly in booster packs (2% chance).
- The spawn chance relative to all other seals can be configured, defaults to 10%.
- Can override the 'Ectoplasm' spectral card to add a black seal instead
- If the 'Ectoplasm' effect override is active, can also disable the hand reduction effect

Download and use Steamodded and follow installation instructions.
As said in the github page of [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/tree/main) put this file here : `"%appdata%\Balatro\Mods"`.

I'm glad if you have any suggestion or request. 

Credits to infarctus for creating the first version of the mod.
