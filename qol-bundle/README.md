# QOL Bundle

A collection of quality-of-life improvements for Balatro.

## How It Works

This mod provides several small adjustments to gameplay mechanics to enhance the overall experience, particularly when using other mods that add new content.

## Features

- **Easier Wheel of Fortune**: Configurable ease for the Wheel of Fortune tarot card. Adjust the chance of hitting the desired outcome (1 = 100% chance, 4 = vanilla 25% chance). Default is 3.
- **Wildcard Fix**: Prevents Wildcard and Smeared Joker from being negatively affected by suit debuffs when they could match a non-debuffed suit.
- **Increased Shop Size**: Increases the base shop size by 1 (default is 2). This helps offset the dilution of the shop pool caused by other mods adding new cards and items.
- **Unweighted Base Editions**: Makes Foil, Holo, and Polychrome editions equally likely when rolled, while preserving the original probability of Negative editions.
- **Configurable 8 Ball Joker**: Adjust the chance of the 8 Ball Joker spawning Tarot cards (1 = 100% chance, 4 = vanilla 25% chance). Default is 4.
- **Reworked Hit the Road Joker**: When enabled, discarded Jacks are returned to the deck alongside the current effect.
- **Square Joker Modification**: Reworks the Square Joker to give +4 chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards, with each scoring card having a 1 in 2 chance to add +4 more chips. Also changes rarity to Uncommon.
- **Flower Pot Wildcard Rework**: Flower Pot only appears in shop when Wildcard-enhanced cards exist in deck and triggers when scoring hand contains any Wildcard.
- **Baron Uncommon**: Makes Baron joker Uncommon rarity with reduced cost ($5 instead of $8).
- **Mime Rare**: Makes Mime joker Rare rarity with increased cost ($6 instead of $5).
- **Satellite Joker Rework**: Satellite now gives gold equal to half the highest poker hand level (rounded up).
- **Controlled Sigil**: Sigil now requires selecting a card first and converts all cards to selected card's suit instead of random suit.
- **Controlled Ouija**: Ouija now requires selecting a card first and converts all cards to selected card's rank instead of random rank.
- **Loyalty Card Rounds Mode**: Loyalty Card triggers based on rounds instead of hands played for more predictable timing and easier to plan around.
- **Splash Joker Retrigger**: Splash Joker additionally retriggers a random scoring card.
- **Ceremonial Dagger Common**: Makes Ceremonial Dagger joker Common rarity with reduced cost ($3 instead of $6).
- **Mail-In Rebate Uncommon**: Makes Mail-In Rebate joker Uncommon rarity (was Common rarity - makes it rarer).
- **Fortune Teller Cheaper**: Makes Fortune Teller joker cheaper (cost $4 instead of $6).
- **Erosion X Mult Rework**: Changes Erosion from +4 Mult per card to X0.2 Mult per card below starting amount.
- **Interest on Skip**: Gain interest when skipping blinds, calculated and awarded before obtaining the tag.
- **Paperback Compatibility**: Added compatibility for Paperback mod's Jester of Nihil joker.
- **Nerf Photochad**: Makes Photograph and Hanging Chad jokers Uncommon rarity.
